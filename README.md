# Conran shop filtering

The Conran Shop is one of those places it only makes sense to shop if there's a massive discount. Enter [the outlet sale](https://www.conranshop.co.uk/outlet.html) - except the website only lets you filter/order by price and not % discount ðŸ™„. This script fixes that.

1. go to [the outlet sale](https://www.conranshop.co.uk/outlet.html)
2. open the dev console
3. copy in the script, hit enter
4. use the `filter` function to hide items discounted by less than a certain amount, e.g. `filter(55)` would hide all items discounted by <55%
5. If you want to change the threshold, just use `filter` again
